- Fix compile error in rust 1.90
- Fix warning when tracing feature is disabled

### 🚜 Refactor

- Use Arc instead of Rc inside SystemDescriptors as they are Send
- [**breaking**] Remove tuple implementation for 16+ length tuples, as tuples may be nested now

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fix unused warning for QuerySets

## [0.1.5] - 2024-07-19

### 🚀 Features

- Use deterministic command execution
